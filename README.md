## 2. Backend Setup

You can choose to set up the backend manually or use an automated shell script.

### Option 1: Manual Setup

1. **Download the Sense2Vec Model**:
   - Download the Sense2Vec model from [this link](https://github.com/explosion/sense2vec/releases/download/v1.0.0/s2v_reddit_2015_md.tar.gz) and extract the contents into the `backend` folder.

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the root repository folder and run the following command to install the required Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run Flask App**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` folder and start the Flask app:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
   - This will activate the backend for the application.

### Option 2: Automated Setup with Shell Script

1. **Run the Setup Script**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` folder and run the following shell script:
     ```bash
