# EduAid: AI Quiz Generation ðŸš€

Online learning has taken the front seat in the post-pandemic age. With the advent of sophisticated AI architectures like Transformers, it is only natural that AI would find its way into education. Learning online via platforms like YouTube or MOOCs is often a method of self-learning. The biggest obstacle faced by students in self-learning is the lack of attention span. An online tool that can generate short quizzes from input educational content can be a great resource for both teachers and students. It helps retain important information, frame questions, and quickly revise large chunks of content.

EduAid is one such project currently available in the form of a browser extension.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/EduAid.git
cd EduAid
```
## 2. Backend Setup

You can choose to set up the backend manually or use an automated shell script.

### Option 1: Manual Setup

1. **Download the Sense2Vec Model**:
   - Download the Sense2Vec model from [this link](https://github.com/explosion/sense2vec/releases/download/v1.0.0/s2v_reddit_2015_md.tar.gz) and extract the contents into the `backend` folder.

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the root repository folder and run the following command to install the required Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run Flask App**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` folder and start the Flask app:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
   - This will activate the backend for the application.

### Option 2: Automated Setup with Shell Script

1. **Run the Setup Script**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` folder and run the following shell script:
     ```bash
     ./script.sh
     ```
   - This script will automatically download and extract the Sense2Vec model, install Python dependencies, and start the Flask app.

### Troubleshooting

- If the script fails to run, ensure that you have execution permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x script.sh


### 3. Configure Google APIs
