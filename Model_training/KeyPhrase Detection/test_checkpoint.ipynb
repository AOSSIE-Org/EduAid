    "Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. They are often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell because they generate most of the cell's energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular respiration, which is the process by which cells convert nutrients into usable energy.\n",
    "The structure of mitochondria consists of an outer membrane, which surrounds the entire organelle, and an inner membrane that is highly folded to form structures called cristae. The inner membrane encloses the mitochondrial matrix, which contains enzymes and DNA molecules necessary for various metabolic reactions.\n",
    "One of the primary functions of mitochondria is to carry out aerobic respiration, a process that uses oxygen to break down glucose and other organic molecules, releasing energy in the form of ATP. This process occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, specifically in the electron transport chain and the citric acid cycle.\n",
    "Apart from energy production, mitochondria have other important roles in the cell. They are involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism, calcium signaling, and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Mitochondria also contain their own DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is separate from the nuclear DNA found in the cell's nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while mitochondria are present in most eukaryotic cells, certain cell types may have varying numbers of mitochondria depending on their energy requirements. For example, muscle cells and liver cells often contain a higher number of mitochondria due to their high energy demands.\n",
